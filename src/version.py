version.py

This module defines the version of the gettext-cloud-translator package.

Attributes:
    __version__ (str): A string representing the version number of the gettext-cloud-translator package.
                      The versioning follows the Semantic Versioning scheme.

Example:
    A version string looks like '0.1.3', where:
    - The first digit (0) represents the major version.
    - The second digit (1) represents the minor version.
    - The third digit (3) represents the patch number.

Notes:
    The version information is used in setup.py for package distribution and can also be used
    within the application to display the current version to the user, for example, in a CLI
    using the '--version' argument.
